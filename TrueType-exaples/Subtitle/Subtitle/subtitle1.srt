<i>So let it go yeah yeah yeah yeah

1109
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,000
<i>Now, there was a time

1110
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,490
<i>When they used to say

1111
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,490
<i>That behind every

1112
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,110
<i>Great man

1113
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,790
<i>There had to be

1114
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,540
<i>A great woman

1115
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,700
<i>But all in these times of change

1116
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,090
<i>You know that it's

1117
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,440
<i>No longer true

1118
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,750
<i>So we're comin' out of the kitchen

1119
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,800
<i>Cause there's somethin'we forgot to say to you

1120
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,810
<i>We say sisters are doin' it

1121
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,980
<i>For themselves

1122
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,080
<i>Standin' on

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,820
<i>Their own two feet

1124
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,340
<i>And ringin' on their own bells

1125
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,270
<i>Sisters are doin' it for themselves

1126
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,280
<i>Now, we ain't makin' stories

1127
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,650
<i>And we ain't layin' plans

1128
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:49,440
<i>Cause a man still loves a woman

1129
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,810
<i>And a woman still loves a man

1130
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,920
<i>Just the same

1131
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,570
<i>Sisters are doin' it for themselves

1132
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:02,500
<i>Standin' on their own two feet

1133
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,400
<i>And ringin' on their own bells

1134
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:12,210
<i>Sisters are doin' it for themselves

1135
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,570
<i>One more time

1136
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,840
<i>Sisters are doin' it for themselves

1137
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,670
<i>Sisters are doin' it for

1138
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,110
<i>Themselves

00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,860
<i>Or capital h-i-m

1141
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,610

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:41,400
<i>'Cause you were born this way, baby

<i>We are all born superstars

1145
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,740
<i>She rolled my hair and put my lipstick on

1146
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,570
<i>In the glass of her boudoir

1147
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,110
<i>"There's nothin wrong with lovin who you are"

1148
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,940
<i>She said, "'cause he made you perfect, babe"

1149
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,380
<i>So hold your head up girl

1150
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,240

1270
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:53,710
<i>This brokenness inside me

1271
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,870
<i>Might start healing

1272
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,230
<i>Out here

1273
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,430
<i>It's like I'm someone else

1274
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,850
<i>I thought that maybe

1275
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:05,220
<i>I could find myself

1276
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:09,090
<i>If I could walk around

1277
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,990
<i>I swear I'll leave

1278
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:15,280
<i>Won't take nothing but a memory

1279
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:20,990
<i>From the house that built me

1280
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,600
<i>Paranoia is in bloom

1281
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,560
<i>The P.R. Transmissions

1282
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,250
<i>Will resume

1283
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,080
<i>They'll try to push drugs

1284
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,650
<i>That keep us all dumbed down

1285
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,290
<i>And hope that we will

1286
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,670
<i>Never see the truth around

1287
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:16,760
<i>So come on

1288
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,530
<i>Another promise, another seed

1289
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,310
<i>Another packaged lie

1290
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,140
<i>To keep us trapped in greed

1291
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:25,030
<i>And all the green belts

1292
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,850
<i>Wrapped around our minds

1293
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,770
<i>And endless red tape

1294
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,480
<i>To keep the truth confined

1295
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:31,830
<i>So come on

1296
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,280
<i>They will not

1297
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,520
<i>Force us

1298
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,780
<i>They will stop

1299
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,030
<i>Degrading us

1300
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:56,330
<i>They will not

1301
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,500
<i>Control us

1302
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,960
<i>We will

1303
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,160
<i>Be victorious

1304
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,510
<i>So come on

1305
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,610
<i>Interchanging mind control

1306
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:17,990
<i>Come let the revolution

1307
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,530
<i>Take its toll

1308
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,280
<i>If you could flick the switch

1309
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:23,190
<i>And open your third eye

1310
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,650
<i>You'd see that we should

1311
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,780
<i>Never be afraid to die

1312
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,920
<i>So come on

1313
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,430
<i>Rise up and take the power back

1314
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,400
<i>It's time the fat cats

1315
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,230
<i>Had a heart attack

1316
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,510
<i>You know that their time has

1317
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,000
<i>Come to an end

1318
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,950
<i>We have to unify

1319
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,970
<i>And watch our flag ascend

1320
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,180
<i>So come on

1321
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,460
<i>They will not

1322
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:56,340
<i>Force us

1323
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,080
<i>They will stop

1324
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:04,140
<i>Degrading us

1325
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:07,440
<i>They will not

1326
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,520
<i>Control us

1327
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,000
<i>We will

1328
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:19,120
<i>Be victorious

1329
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,610
<i>So come on

1330
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,980
<i>They will not

1331
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,850
<i>Force us

1332
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:07,520
<i>They will stop

1333
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:11,600
<i>Degrading us

1334
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,010
<i>They will not

1335
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,830
<i>Control us

1336
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,540
<i>We will

1337
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:26,520
<i>Be victorious

1338
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:59,560
<i>Beautiful Girls

1339
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,960
<i>All over the world

1340
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,860
<i>I could be chasing

1341
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,650
<i>But my time would be wasted

1342
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,210
<i>They got nothing on you, baby

1343
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:15,610
<i>Nothing on you, baby

1344
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,640
<i>I know you feel where I'm coming from

1345
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,080
<i>Regardles of the things in my past that I've done

1346
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,440
<i>Most of really was for the hell of the fun

1347
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,160
<i>On the carousel so around I spun

1348
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,300
<i>With no directions just trying to get some

1349
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,590
<i>Trying to chase skirts living in the summer sun

1350
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:34,160
<i>So I lost more than I had ever won

1351
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,060
<i>And honestly

1352
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,490
<i>I ended up with none

1353
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:37,890
<i>There's no much nonsense

1354
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,180
<i>It's on my conscience

1355
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:41,030
<i>I'm thinking, baby I should get it out

1356
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,670
<i>And I don't want to sound redundant

1357
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,870
<i>But I was wondering

1358
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:45,740
<i>That there's something that you want to know

1359
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,560
<i>But never mind

1360
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,390
<i>That we should let it go

1361
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,360
<i>'Cause we don't want to be a TV episode

1362
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,010
<i>And all the bad thought just let them go

1363
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:55,420
<i>Go, go

1364
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,230

<i>I could be chasing

1367
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,130

<i>And I might say hey

1376
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,770
<i>But you shouldn't worry

1377
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:22,970
<i>About what they say

1378
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,300

<i>Or a car or a train

1390

<i>No other girl's in my brain

<i>Wanna say good-bye

1453
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:07,800
<i>Don't you cry

1454
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:37,320
<i>You got it, you got it bad

1455
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:39,020
<i>When you're on the phone

1456
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,800
<i>Hang up and you call right back

1457
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,790
<i>You got it, you got it bad

1458
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,160
<i>When you miss a day without your friend

1459
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,160
<i>Your whole life's off track

1460
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,980
<i>And you got it bad when you're stuck in the house

1461
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,850
<i>You don't wanna have fun

1462
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,820
<i>It's all you think about

1463
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:31,300
<i>Baby, baby, baby

1464
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:35,170
<i>I'm like baby, baby, baby

1465
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:39,530
<i>I'm like baby, baby, baby

1466
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,460
<i>I thought you'd always be mine, mine

1467
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:45,380
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah

1468
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,300
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah

1469
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,260
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah

1470
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,200
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah

1471
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,760
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah

1472
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,100
<i>Now I'm all gone, gone, gone

1473
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:04,140
<i>I'm gone

1474
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:41,570
<i>Never say never, never, never

1475
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:55,620
<i>I never thought they could walk through fire

1476
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:00,040
<i>Yeah, I never thought that I could take the burn

1477
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:06,060
<i>I never had the strength to take it higher

1478
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,970
<i>Until I reached the point of no return

1479
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:13,430
<i>And there's just no turning back

1480
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:15,820
<i>When your hearts under attack

1481
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,540
<i>Gonna give everything I have

1482
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:25,220
<i>I will never say never

1483
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,680
<i>I will fight

1484
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,160
<i>I will fight till forever

1485
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,330
<i>Make it right

1486
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:33,860
<i>Whenever you knock me down

1487
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,400
<i>I will not stay on the ground

1488
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,630
<i>Pick it up, pick it up

1489
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,960
<i>Pick it up, pick it up up up

1490
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,720
<i>And never say never

1491
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,020
<i>I will never say never

1492
00:50:45,070 --> 00:50:46,570
<i>I will fight

1493
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:50,080
<i>I will fight till forever

1494
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,170
<i>Make it right

1495
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,650
<i>Whenever you knock me down

1496
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:56,100
<i>I will not stay on the ground

1497
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:57,390
<i>Pick it up, pick it up

1498
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:59,270
<i>Pick it up, pick it up up up

1499
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:01,590
<i>And never say never

1500
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:03,480
<i>J, guess who

1501
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,270
<i>J Smith and J.B.

1502
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:06,800
<i>I can handle him

1503
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:08,780
<i>I can handle him

1504
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:12,210
<i>Now he's bigger than me

1505
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,070
<i>Taller than me

1506
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,600
<i>And he's older than me

1507
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,480
<i>And stronger than me

1508
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,720
<i>And his arms a little bit longer than me

1509
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:20,330
<i>But he ain't on a J.B. song with me

1510
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:21,250
<i>I be trying a chill

1511
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,730
<i>They be trying to side with the thrill

1512
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:25,230
<i>No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will

1513
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:26,590
<i>Like Luke with the force

1514
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:27,790
<i>When push comes to shove

1515
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:30,170
<i>Like Cobe with the 4th, ice water with blood

1516
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,120
<i>I gotta be the best, and yes

1517
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:32,910
<i>We're the flyest

1518
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:33,980
<i>Like David and Goliath

1519
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:35,730
<i>I conquered the giant

1520
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,670
<i>So now I got the world in my hand

1521
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:38,890
<i>I was born from two stars

1522
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:40,850
<i>So the moon's where I land

1523
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:44,460
<i>I will never say never

1524
00:51:44,490 --> 00:51:45,870
<i>I will fight

1525
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,550
<i>I will fight till forever

1526
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:50,700
<i>Make it right

1527
00:51:50,730 --> 00:51:53,090
<i>Whenever you knock me down

1528
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,540
<i>I will not stay on the ground

1529
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,810
<i>Pick it up, pick it up

1530
00:51:56,850 --> 00:51:58,980
<i>Pick it up, pick it up up up

1531
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:01,640
<i>And never say never

1532
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:10,530
<i>Oh, my gosh

1533
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:15,860
<i>Baby, let me love you down

1534
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,370
<i>There's so many ways to love ya

1535
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,920
<i>Baby, I can break ya down

1536
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,740
<i>There's so many ways to love ya

1537
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:32,120
<i>Got me like "oh my god, I'm so in love"

1538
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,570
<i>I found you finally

1539
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:35,980
<i>You make me want to say

1540
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:42,580
<i>Oh,oh, oh, oh, oh,oh, oh, oh, oh

1541
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:04,280
<i>Oh, baby, you got it all

1542
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:07,700
<i>Sexy from her head to the toes

1543
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,460
<i>And I wanna know, know, know

1544
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,410
<i>There's so many ways to love ya

1545
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:21,910
<i>Baby, I can break ya down

1546
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,890
<i>So many ways to love ya

1547
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:31,210
<i>Got me like "oh my god, I'm so in love"

1548
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:33,600
<i>I found you finally

1549
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,120
<i>You make me want to say

1550
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:41,210
<i>Oh,oh, oh, oh, oh,oh, oh, oh, oh

1551
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:43,050
<i>Oh, my gosh

1552
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,070
<i>Oh, my gosh

1553
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,650
<i>Oh, my

1554
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,450
<i>Oh, my

1555
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,360
<i>Oh, my, oh, my

1556
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,200
<i>Oh, my gosh

1557
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:02,620
<i>I did it again

1558
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:04,760
<i>so I'm gone let the beat drop

1559
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,280
<i>Oh, my gosh

1560
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:22,220
<i>Oh, oh, oh, my

1561
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,500
<i>Oh, oh, oh, my

1562
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:25,400
<i>My, my, my, my, my

1563
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:28,150
<i>Oh, my gosh

1564
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:29,110
<i>It's empty in the valley of your heart

1565
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,950
<i>The sun, it rises slowly

1566
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,520
<i>As you walk away

1567
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,240
<i>From all the fears and all the faults

1568
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,460
<i>You've left behind

1569
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,070
<i>The harvest left no food

1570
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:41,630
<i>For you to eat

1571
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:44,770
<i>You cannibal you meat eater you see

1572
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,270
<i>But I have seen the same

1573
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:50,160
<i>I know the shame in your defeat

1574
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:54,930
<i>But I will hold on hope

1575
01:02:54,930 --> 01:02:58,280
<i>And I won't let you choke

1576
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,050
<i>On the noose around your neck

1577
01:03:01,050 --> 01:03:04,430
<i>And I'll find strength in pain

1578
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:07,600
<i>And I will change my ways

1579
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:10,590
<i>Know my name as it's called again

1580
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:27,220
<i>Cause I have other things to fill my time

1581
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:30,410
<i>You take what is yours and I'll take mine

1582
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:31,680
<i>Now let me at the truth

1583
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:35,730
<i>Which will refresh my broken mind

1584
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,750
<i>So tie me to a post and block my ears

1585
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:43,280
<i>I can see widows and orphans through my tears

1586
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,450
<i>Know my call despite my faults

1587
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:48,860
<i>And despite my growing fears

1588
01:03:50,300 --> 01:03:53,410
<i>So make your siren's call

1589
01:03:53,410 --> 01:03:56,670
<i>And sing all you want

1590
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:59,690
<i>I will not hear what you have to say

1591
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:03,030
<i>Cause I need freedom now

1592
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:06,190
<i>And I need to know how

1593
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,610
<i>To live my life as it's meant to be

1594
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,940
<i>And I will hold on hope

1595
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,660
<i>And I won't let you choke

1596
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,630
<i>On the noose around your neck

1597
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:42,990
<i>And I'll find strength in pain

1598
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:46,220
<i>And I will change my ways

1599
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:52,500
<i>I'll know my name as it's called again

1600
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:03,070
<i>There's a darkness upon me that's flooded in light

1601
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:07,960
<i>In the fine print they tell me

1602
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,830
<i>What's wrong and what's right

1603
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:17,760
<i>And it comes in black and it comes in white

1604
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:21,610
<i>And I'm frightened by those who don't see it

1605
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:29,410
<i>When nothing is owed or deserved or expected

1606
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:34,560
<i>And your life doesn't change

1607
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,000
<i>By the man that's elected

1608
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:42,090
<i>If you're loved by someone

1609
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,250
<i>You're never rejected

1610
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,880
<i>Decide what to be and go be it

1611
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,070
一起来

1612
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,720
<i>There was a dream

1613
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,890
<i>And one day I could see it

1614
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,910
<i>Like a bird in a cage I broke in

1615
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:04,120
<i>And demanded that somebody free it

1616
01:06:05,300 --> 01:06:07,590
<i>And there was a kid

1617
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,400
<i>With a head full of doubt

1618
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:14,770
<i>So I'll scream till I die

1619
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:18,840
<i>And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out

1620
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,230
<i>There's a darkness upon you

1621
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:28,450
<i>That's flooded in light

1622
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,760
<i>And in the fine print they tell you

1623
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,010
<i>What's wrong and what's right

1624
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:41,020
<i>And it flies by day and it flies by night

1625
01:06:41,020 --> 01:06:44,400
<i>And I'm frightened by those that don't see it

1626
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:48,160
<i>There was a dream

1627
01:06:49,370 --> 01:06:51,880
<i>And one day I could see it

1628
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:55,770
<i>Like a bird in a cage I broke in

1629
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:59,850
<i>And demanded that somebody free it

1630
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,100
<i>And there was a kid

1631
01:07:04,510 --> 01:07:06,730
<i>With a head full of doubt

1632
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,000
<i>So I'll scream till I die

1633
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,640
<i>And the last of those bad thoughts are finally out

1634
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:17,060
<i>There's a darkness upon me

1635
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:19,950
<i>That's flooded in light

1636
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:25,050
<i>In the fine print they tell me

1637
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:28,420
<i>What's wrong and what's right

1638
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:54,120
<i>I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

1639
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:58,350
<i>I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

1640
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:00,410
<i>I wake up every morning

1641
01:08:00,430 --> 01:08:02,560
<i>Hold my hands and pray for rain

1642
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,640
<i>I've got a head full of ideas

1643
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:06,540
<i>Driving me insane

1644
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:10,440
<i>It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor

1645
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:14,870
<i>Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

1646
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:22,700
<i>I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

1647
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:26,940
<i>I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more

1648
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,020
<i>He hands you a nickel

1649
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,000
<i>He hands you a dime

1650
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,040
<i>He asks you and your friends

1651
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:35,020
<i>If you're having a good time

1652
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:39,310
<i>He blames you every time you slam the door

1653
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:43,350
<i>I ain't gonna work on Maggie's brother no more

1654
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:51,180
<i>Well, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more

1655
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:55,380
<i>I ain't gonna work for Maggie's Pa no more

1656
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,180
<i>He stubs his cigarette out

1657
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:59,310
<i>In your face just for kicks

1658
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:03,690
<i>His bedroom window is made out of bricks

1659
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:07,270
<i>And the National Guard are standing at his door

1660
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:11,950
<i>Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's Pa no more

1661
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,800
<i>Well, I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

1662
01:09:20,230 --> 01:09:23,890
<i>I ain't gonna work for Maggie's ma no more

1663
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:26,030
<i>She talks to all the servants

1664
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:28,530
<i>About man and God and law

1665
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:32,360
<i>And everybody tell me she's the brains behind Pa

1666
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:36,050
<i>She's sixty-eight, but claim's she's twenty-four

1667
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:40,620
<i>Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

1668
01:09:45,010 --> 01:09:48,630
<i>Well, I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

1669
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:52,630
<i>I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

1670
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,770
<i>I try so hard

1671
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,240
<i>To be just who I am

1672
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:00,740
<i>But everybody wants you to be just like them

1673
01:10:00,790 --> 01:10:05,570
<i>They say "see, while you're playing I get bored"

1674
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:09,450
<i>I ain't gonna work on Maggie's farm no more

1675
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:52,270
<i>If you don't know me by now

1676
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:57,830
<i>You will never never never know me

1677
01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:07,140
<i>If you don't know me by now

1678
01:13:08,010 --> 01:13:12,830
<i>You will never never never know me

1679
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,320
<i>She grow up on the side of the road

1680
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:40,170
<i>Where the church bells ring and strong love grows

1681
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:46,040
<i>She grew up good, she grew up slow

1682
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:49,220
<i>Like American honey

1683
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:57,890
<i>Steady as a preacher, free as a weed

1684
01:13:58,150 --> 01:14:00,560
<i>Couldn't wait to get going

1685
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,990
<i>But wasn't quite ready to leave

1686
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:10,150
<i>So innocent pure and sweet

1687
01:14:10,340 --> 01:14:13,270
<i>American Honey

1688
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:22,460
<i>There's a wild wild whisper blown in the wind

1689
01:14:22,460 --> 01:14:28,320
<i>Callin' out my name like a long lost friend

1690
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:34,730
<i>Oh I miss those days as the years go by

1691
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:39,170
<i>Oh nothings sweeter than summertime

1692
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:43,450
<i>And American honey

1693
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:51,980
<i>And American honey

1694
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:05,090
<i>It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now

1695
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:10,070
<i>And I said I wouldn't call

1696
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:15,370
<i>But I'm a little drunk and I need you now

1697
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:25,660
<i>It's a quarter after one, I'm all alone and I need you now

1698
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:35,650
<i>Said I wouldn't call but I lost all control and I need you now

1699
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:42,900
<i>And I don't know how I can do without

1700
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:48,970
<i>I just need you now

1701
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:59,480
<i>I just need you now

1702
01:16:02,620 --> 01:16:06,550
<i>I just need you now

1703
01:19:44,140 --> 01:19:53,900
<i>I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love

1704
01:19:53,900 --> 01:19:56,800
<i>And I'm like forget you

1705
01:19:57,950 --> 01:20:01,690
<i>I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough

1706
01:20:01,690 --> 01:20:06,000
<i>And I'm like forget you, and forget her too

1707
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,200
<i>If I was richer, I'd still be with you

1708
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:12,810
<i>Ain't that some shhhh? (ain't that some shhhh?)

1709
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:15,080
<i>And although there's pain in my chest

1710
01:20:15,090 --> 01:20:19,610
<i>Still wish you the best with a...forget you

1711
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:23,990
<i>Yeah I'm sorry, I can't afford a ferrari,

1712
01:20:27,790 --> 01:20:31,420
<i>I guess she's an Xbox and I'm more Atari

1713
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,740
<i>But the way you play your game ain't fair.

1714
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:39,630
<i>I pity the fool that falls in love with you

1715
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,460
<i>(Oh oh she's a gold digger, just thought you should know)

1716
01:20:45,450 --> 01:20:47,150
<i>I've got some news for you

1717
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:50,430
<i>Yeah go run and tell your little girlfriend

<i>and I'm like forget you and forget her too

1722
01:21:05,820 --> 01:21:10,010
<i>Said, if I was richer, I'd still be with ya

<i>I still wish you the best with a, forget you

1726
01:21:20,970 --> 01:21:24,290
<i>Now I know that I had to borrow

1727
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:27,300
<i>Beg and steal and lie and cheat

1728
01:21:28,580 --> 01:21:31,990
<i>Trying to keep you, trying to please you

1729
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,670
<i>Cause being in love with you ass ain't cheap

1730
01:21:34,670 --> 01:21:39,920
<i>Now, I pity the fool that falls in love with you

<i>There was nothing wrong it didn't fit

1767
01:25:35,450 --> 01:25:37,490
<i>It wasn't right

1768
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:39,430
<i>Wasn't just the size

1769
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:42,430
<i>They say you know when you know

1770
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:45,280
<i>I don't know

1771
01:25:50,790 --> 01:25:53,160
<i>I didn't feel

1772
01:25:53,160 --> 01:25:56,740
<i>The fairy tale feeling

1773
01:25:56,740 --> 01:26:03,910
<i>No am I a stupid girl

1774
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:10,660
<i>For even dreaming that I could

1775
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:18,100
<i>If it's not like the movies

1776
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:23,290
<i>That's why it should be, yeah

1777
01:26:23,660 --> 01:26:27,050
<i>When he's the one, I'll come undone

1778
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:31,100
<i>And your world will stop spinning

1779
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:36,220
<i>And that's just the beginning

1780
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,810
<i>'Cause I know you're out there

1781
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:48,210
<i>And you're looking for me

1782
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:53,430
<i>It's crazy idea that

1783
01:26:54,440 --> 01:27:00,740
<i>That you were made perfectly for me

1784
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,330
<i>You'll see

1785
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:10,280
<i>Just like the movies

1786
01:27:12,330 --> 01:27:15,330
<i>That's how it will be

1787
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:23,120
<i>Cinematic and dramatic with the perfect ending

1788
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,250
<i>It's not like the movies

1789
01:27:30,330 --> 01:27:33,620
<i>But that's how it should be

1790
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:36,690
<i>When he's the one

1791
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:38,580
<i>You'll come undone

1792
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:41,880
<i>And your world will stop spinning

1793
01:27:43,690 --> 01:27:47,930
<i>And it's just the beginning

1794
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:14,470
<i>Cause you make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream

1795
01:28:14,470 --> 01:28:16,100
<i>The way you turn me on

1796
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:18,280
<i>I can't sleep

1797
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,670
<i>Let's run away

1798
01:28:19,670 --> 01:28:21,790
<i>And don't ever look back

1799
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:23,810
<i>Don't ever look back

1800
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:26,490
<i>My heart stops

1801
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:28,130
<i>When you look at me

1802
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:30,430
<i>Just one touch

1803
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:32,050
<i>Now baby I believe

1804
01:28:32,050 --> 01:28:34,370
<i>This is real

1805
01:28:34,370 --> 01:28:35,630
<i>So take a chance

1806
01:28:35,630 --> 01:28:37,740
<i>And don't ever look back

1807
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:39,480
<i>Don't ever look back

1808
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:41,770
<i>I might get your heart racing

1809
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:43,860
<i>In my skin-tight jeans

1810
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:47,140
<i>Be your teenage dream tonight

1811
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:49,850
<i>Let you put your hands on me

1812
01:28:49,900 --> 01:28:51,830
<i>In my skin-tight jeans

1813
01:28:51,830 --> 01:28:54,980
<i>Be your teenage dream tonight

1814
01:29:03,770 --> 01:29:10,330
<i>Cause you make me feel like I'm living a teenage dream

1815
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:12,030
<i>The way you turn me on

1816
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:14,190
<i>I can't sleep

1817
01:29:14,190 --> 01:29:15,570
<i>Let's runaway

1818
01:29:15,570 --> 01:29:17,710
<i>And don't ever look back

1819
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:19,940
<i>Don't ever look back

1820
01:29:20,300 --> 01:29:22,390
<i>My heart stops

1821
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:24,030
<i>When you look at me

1822
01:29:24,030 --> 01:29:26,230
<i>Just one touch

1823
01:29:26,230 --> 01:29:27,920
<i>Now baby I believe

1824
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,290
<i>This is real

1825
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:31,520
<i>So take a chance

1826
01:29:31,520 --> 01:29:33,700
<i>And don't ever look back

1827
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,450
<i>Don't ever look back

1828
01:29:35,450 --> 01:29:37,620
<i>I might get your heart racing

1829
01:29:37,620 --> 01:29:39,740

<i>Be your teenage dream tonight

1834
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:31,440
<i>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

1835
01:30:31,700 --> 01:30:35,850
<i>Im begging of you please don't take my man

1836
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:42,960
<i>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

1837
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,790
<i>Please don't take him just because you can

1838
01:30:49,870 --> 01:30:52,130
<i>Her beauty is beyond compare

1839
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:54,630
<i>With flaming locks of auburn hair

1840
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:58,520
<i>With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green

1841
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:02,510
<i>Her smile is like a breath of spring

1842
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:04,850
<i>Voice is soft like summer rain

1843
01:31:04,850 --> 01:31:08,370
<i>And I cannot compete with her, Jolene

1844
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:16,290
<i>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

1845
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:20,950
<i>Im begging of you please don't take my man

1846
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:27,940
<i>Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

1847
01:31:28,150 --> 01:31:32,290
<i>Please don't take him just because you can

1848
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:35,950
<i>Jolene

1849
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:10,880
<i>On the first page of our story

1850
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:16,530
<i>The future seemed so bright

1851
01:36:17,490 --> 01:36:22,590
<i>Then this thing turned out so evil

1852
01:36:22,710 --> 01:36:28,400
<i>I don't know why I'm still surprised

1853
01:36:29,020 --> 01:36:35,060
<i>Even angels have their wicked schemes

1854
01:36:35,060 --> 01:36:41,050
<i>And you take that to new extremes

1855
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:45,970
<i>But you'll always be my hero

1856
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:51,010
<i>Even though you lost your mind

1857
01:36:51,740 --> 01:36:56,750
<i>Just gonna stand there and watch me burn

1858
01:36:57,170 --> 01:37:03,000
<i>But that's alright because I like the way it hurts

1859
01:37:03,310 --> 01:37:08,540
<i>Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

1860
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:14,310
<i>But that's alright because I love the way you lie

1861
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:17,520
<i>I love the way you lie

1862
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:22,980
<i>Ohhh, I love the way you lie

1863
01:37:27,150 --> 01:37:33,120
<i>So maybe I'm a masochist

1864
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:39,080
<i>I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave

1865
01:37:39,080 --> 01:37:44,630
<i>Till the walls are goin' up

1866
01:37:44,630 --> 01:37:50,650
<i>In smoke with all our memories

1867
01:37:50,650 --> 01:37:52,820
<i>It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face

1868
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:55,770
<i>Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction

1869
01:37:55,770 --> 01:37:58,530
<i>Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry

1870
01:37:58,530 --> 01:38:00,910
<i>That you pushed me into the coffee table last night

1871
01:38:00,920 --> 01:38:02,620
<i>So I can push you off me

1872
01:38:02,620 --> 01:38:05,400
<i>Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me

1873
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:08,260
<i>Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy

1874
01:38:08,270 --> 01:38:10,900
<i>Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me

1875
01:38:10,900 --> 01:38:14,060
<i>Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me

1876
01:38:14,060 --> 01:38:16,600
<i>Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the

1877
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:19,820
<i>Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we

1878
01:38:19,820 --> 01:38:22,850
<i>Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs

1879
01:38:22,850 --> 01:38:25,540
<i>That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky

1880
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:28,980
<i>Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills

1881
01:38:28,980 --> 01:38:31,360
<i>You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'

1882
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:33,910
<i>I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count

1883
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:36,910
<i>But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain

1884
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:39,790
<i>Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counsellin'

1885
01:38:39,790 --> 01:38:42,930
<i>This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand

1886
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:45,430
<i>Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it

1887
01:38:45,430 --> 01:38:47,840
<i>With you I'm in my f-ckin' mind, without you, I'm out it

1888
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:52,810
<i>Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

1889
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:58,390
<i>But that's all right because I love the way you lie

1890
01:38:58,440 --> 01:39:01,000
<i>I love the way you lie

1891
01:39:02,960 --> 01:39:06,630
<i>I'm about to lose my mind

1892
01:39:06,630 --> 01:39:09,300
<i>You've been gone for so long

1893
01:39:09,300 --> 01:39:12,590
<i>I'm running out of time

1894
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:16,500
<i>I need a doctor

1895
01:39:16,510 --> 01:39:19,450
<i>Call me a doctor

1896
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:23,780
<i>I need a doctor, doctor

1897
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:27,190
<i>To bring me back to life

1898
01:39:27,190 --> 01:39:29,560
<i>I told the world, one day I would pay it back

1899
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:33,490
<i>Say it on tape and lay it, record it, so that one day I could play it back

1900
01:39:33,490 --> 01:39:36,580
<i>But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that

1901
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:39,680
<i>Doubt startin' to creep in, everyday it's just so grey and black

1902
01:39:39,680 --> 01:39:41,430
<i>Hope, I just need a ray of that

1903
01:39:41,430 --> 01:39:42,720
<i>'Cause no one sees my vision

1904
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:44,950
<i>When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack

1905
01:39:44,950 --> 01:39:46,360
<i>But they don't know what dope is

1906
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,680
<i>And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this

1907
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:51,780
<i>All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest

1908
01:39:51,780 --> 01:39:54,930
<i>You picked me up, breathed new life in me. I owe my life to you

1909
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:58,050
<i>Before the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do

1910
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:01,540
<i>But it just dawned on me; you lost a son. See this light in you? It's dark

1911
01:40:01,540 --> 01:40:04,180
<i>Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you

1912
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:07,260
<i>I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue

1913
01:40:07,260 --> 01:40:10,090
<i>'Cause me and you, we're like a crew. I was like your sidekick

1914
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:12,910
<i>You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this f-cking mic

1915
01:40:12,910 --> 01:40:16,630
<i>Or you gon' hug me. But I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do cause

1916
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:20,430
<i>I'm about to lose my mind

1917
01:40:20,440 --> 01:40:23,060
<i>You've been gone for so long

1918
01:40:23,060 --> 01:40:26,340
<i>I'm running out of time

1919
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:30,440
<i>I need a doctor

1920
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:33,220
<i>Call me a doctor

1921
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:37,700
<i>I need a doctor, doctor

1922
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:41,100
<i>To bring me back to life

1923
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,760
<i>It hurts when I see you struggle

1924
01:40:42,770 --> 01:40:44,340
<i>You come to me with ideas

1925
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:46,140
<i>You say that these are pieces, so I'm puzzled

1926
01:40:46,140 --> 01:40:47,650
<i>'Cause the sh-t I hear is crazy

1927
01:40:47,650 --> 01:40:50,930
<i>But you're either getting lazy, or you don't believe in you no more

1928
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:53,350
<i>Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

1929
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:56,170
<i>Can't make a decision, you keep questioning yourself

1930
01:40:56,170 --> 01:40:59,440
<i>Second guessing, and it's almost like your begging for my help

1931
01:40:59,440 --> 01:41:00,320
<i>Like, I'm YOUR leader

1932
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:02,510
<i>You're supposed to freaking be MY mentor

1933
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:03,750
<i>I can endure no more

1934
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:05,490
<i>I demand you remember who you are

1935
01:41:05,490 --> 01:41:07,200
<i>It was you, who believed in me

1936
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,220
<i>When everyone was telling you, don't sign me

1937
01:41:09,220 --> 01:41:11,960
<i>Everyone at the freaking label, lets tell the truth

1938
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:15,010
<i>You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you

1939
01:41:15,010 --> 01:41:16,580
<i>Nobody wanted to f-ck with the white boy

1940
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:18,340
<i>Dre, I'm crying in this booth

1941
01:41:18,340 --> 01:41:21,160
<i>You saved my life, now maybe it's my time to save yours

1942
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:24,170
<i>But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more

1943
01:41:24,170 --> 01:41:27,160
<i>But I ain't giving up faith, and you ain't giving up on me

1944
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:30,410
<i>Get up Dre! I'm dying, I need you, come back for f-ck's sake

1945
01:41:30,410 --> 01:41:34,250
<i>I'm about to lose my mind

1946
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,970
<i>You've been gone for so long

1947
01:41:36,970 --> 01:41:40,040
<i>I'm running out of time

1948
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:43,930
<i>I need a doctor

1949
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:47,080
<i>Call me a doctor

1950
01:41:47,300 --> 01:41:50,060
<i>I need a doctor, doctor

1951
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:54,140
女士们先生们  Dr. Dre

1952
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:57,510
<i>It literally feels like a lifetime ago

1953
01:41:57,510 --> 01:42:00,650
<i>But I still remember the sh-t like it was just yesterday though

1954
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:02,770
<i>You walked in, yellow jump suit

1955
01:42:02,770 --> 01:42:04,110
<i>Whole room, cracked jokes

1956
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:07,240
<i>Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke

1957
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:09,440
<i>Went through friends, some of them I put on

1958
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,240
<i>But they just left, they said was riding to the death

1959
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:13,840
<i>But where are they now

1960
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,930
<i>Now that I need them, I don't see none of them

1961
01:42:15,930 --> 01:42:18,120
<i>All I see is Slim f-ck all you fairweather friends

1962
01:42:18,120 --> 01:42:19,370
<i>All I need is him

1963
01:42:19,370 --> 01:42:20,560
<i>F-cking backstabbers

1964
01:42:20,560 --> 01:42:22,590
<i>When the chips were down, you just laughed at us

1965
01:42:22,590 --> 01:42:26,390
<i>Now you bout to feel the f-cking wrath of aftermath, damn it

1966
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:28,120
<i>You gon' see us in our lab jackets

1967
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:29,740
<i>And ask where the hell we been

1968
01:42:29,740 --> 01:42:32,020

02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:13,070
<i>Well, some people singing

2152
02:17:13,070 --> 02:17:14,970
<i>Sounds like screaming

2153
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:17,810
<i>Used to doubt it buy now I believe it

2154
02:17:19,090 --> 02:17:21,630
<i>Month of May, everybody's in love

2155
02:17:21,960 --> 02:17:24,480
<i>In the city, watch it from above and

2156
02:17:24,480 --> 02:17:27,110
<i>Just when I knew what I wanted to say

2157
02:17:27,140 --> 02:17:29,790
<i>The violent wind blew the wires away

2158
02:17:32,500 --> 02:17:34,440
<i>We were shocked in the suburbs

2159
02:17:35,270 --> 02:17:36,240
<i>Kids are all standing

2160
02:17:36,240 --> 02:17:38,040
<i>With their arms folded tight

2161
02:17:38,050 --> 02:17:38,990
<i>Kids are all standing

2162
02:17:38,990 --> 02:17:40,450
<i>With their arms folded tight

2163
02:17:40,450 --> 02:17:41,940
<i>Well, some things are pure

2164
02:17:41,940 --> 02:17:43,360
<i>And some things are right

2165
02:17:43,360 --> 02:17:44,380
<i>But the kids are still standing

2166
02:17:44,380 --> 02:17:46,340
<i>With their arms folded tight

2167
02:17:47,630 --> 02:17:48,690
<i>Well, some things are pure

2168
02:17:48,690 --> 02:17:50,250
<i>And some things are right

2169
02:17:50,300 --> 02:17:51,250
<i>But the kids are still standing

2170
02:17:51,250 --> 02:17:53,090
<i>With their arms folded tight

2171
02:17:54,720 --> 02:17:55,720
<i>So young

2172
02:17:56,070 --> 02:17:57,030
<i>So young

2173
02:17:57,320 --> 02:18:00,100
<i>So much pain for someone so young well

2174
02:18:00,200 --> 02:18:02,500
<i>I know it's heavy I know it ain't light

2175
02:18:02,500 --> 02:18:04,690
<i>But how you gonna lift with your arms

2176
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:06,340
<i>Folded

2177
02:18:14,930 --> 02:18:16,180
<i>First, they built the road

2178
02:18:16,180 --> 02:18:17,500
<i>Then they built the town

2179
02:18:17,500 --> 02:18:20,090
<i>That's why we're still driving around

2180
02:18:20,090 --> 02:18:21,440
<i>And around and around and around

2181
02:18:21,440 --> 02:18:23,140
<i>And around and around and around

2182
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:25,270
<i>And around and around and around

2183
02:18:25,270 --> 02:18:27,240
<i>And around and around

2184
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,030
<i>Two thousand and nine

2185
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:32,400
<i>Two thousand and ten

2186
02:18:32,400 --> 02:18:34,750
<i>Wanna make a record how I felt then

2187
02:18:34,750 --> 02:18:37,510
<i>When I stood outside in the month of May

2188
02:18:37,510 --> 02:18:38,830
<i>Watched the violent wind

2189
02:18:38,830 --> 02:18:40,430
<i>Blow the wires away

2190
02:18:42,280 --> 02:18:44,540
<i>If I died in the month of May

2191
02:18:45,110 --> 02:18:47,560
<i>Let the wind take my body away, well

2192
02:18:47,560 --> 02:18:49,800
<i>I wish I may, I wish I might

2193
02:18:49,990 --> 02:18:52,620
<i>Make me down there with my arms

2194
02:18:52,830 --> 02:18:53,930
<i>Folded

2195
02:19:08,030 --> 02:19:10,520
<i>Start again in the month of May

2196
02:19:10,670 --> 02:19:13,160
<i>Start again in the month of May

2197
02:19:13,710 --> 02:19:15,770
<i>Come on and blow the wires away

2198
02:19:16,330 --> 02:19:18,480
<i>Come on and blow the wires away

2199
02:19:18,850 --> 02:19:21,230
<i>Start again in the month of May

2200
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:23,870
<i>Start again in the month of May

2201
02:19:24,450 --> 02:19:26,670
<i>Come on and blow the wires away

2202
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:29,230
<i>Come on and blow the wires away

2203
02:19:29,670 --> 02:19:32,000
<i>Start again in the month of May

2204
02:19:32,370 --> 02:19:34,730
<i>Start again in the month of May

2205
02:19:35,130 --> 02:19:37,570
<i>Come on and blow the wires away

2206
02:19:37,870 --> 02:19:39,680
<i>Come on and blow the wires

2207
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:41,640
<i>The wires away

2208
02:24:16,410 --> 02:24:18,900
<i>If the businessmen drink my blood

2209
02:24:20,730 --> 02:24:23,640
<i>like the kids in art school says they would

2210
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,040
<i>And I guess I'll just begin again

2211
02:24:30,730 --> 02:24:33,050
<i>You say can we still be friends

2212
02:24:37,080 --> 02:24:38,900
<i>If I was scared

2213
02:24:39,630 --> 02:24:40,870
<i>I would

2214
02:24:42,080 --> 02:24:43,930
<i>And if I was bored

2215
02:24:44,020 --> 02:24:46,040
<i>You know I would

2216
02:24:47,080 --> 02:24:48,460
<i>And if I was yours

2217
02:24:49,220 --> 02:24:50,520
<i>But I'm not

2218
02:24:54,760 --> 02:24:57,040
<i>All the kids have always known

2219
02:24:59,430 --> 02:25:02,290
<i>That the emperor wears no clothes

2220
02:25:04,190 --> 02:25:06,510
<i>But bow to down to them anyway

2221
02:25:08,730 --> 02:25:11,410
<i>It's better than to be alone

2222
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:17,160
<i>If I was scared

2223
02:25:18,010 --> 02:25:19,580
<i>I would

2224
02:25:20,670 --> 02:25:22,180

02:25:25,380 --> 02:25:26,850
<i>And if I was yours

2227
02:25:27,570 --> 02:25:29,000
<i>But I'm not

2228
02:25:33,150 --> 02:25:35,540
<i>Now you're knocking at my door

2229
02:25:37,530 --> 02:25:40,100
<i>Saying please come out against the night

2230
02:25:42,690 --> 02:25:44,960
<i>But I would rather be alone

2231
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:49,990
<i>Than pretend I feel alright

2232
02:25:52,430 --> 02:25:54,750
<i>If the businessmen drink my blood

2233
02:25:56,740 --> 02:25:59,280
<i>Like the kids in art school said they would

2234
02:26:01,650 --> 02:26:03,860
<i>Then I guess I'll just begin again

2235
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:08,910
<i>You say can we still be friends

2236
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:14,470
<i>If I was scared

2237
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:16,780
<i>I would

2238
02:26:18,030 --> 02:26:19,520
<i>And if I was pure

2239
02:26:19,860 --> 02:26:21,660
<i>You know I would

2240
02:26:22,800 --> 02:26:24,330
<i>And if I was yours

02:26:25,110 --> 02:26:26,420
<i>But I'm not

2242
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:30,900
<i>Now I'm ready to start

2243
02:26:32,570 --> 02:26:34,100
<i>If I was scared

2244
02:26:34,500 --> 02:26:35,900
<i>I would

2245
02:26:37,150 --> 02:26:38,560
